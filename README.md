This project looks at the relationship between sleep hours, screen time, and study hours
to understand how different lifestyle habits affect students’ study patterns.

The analysis includes basic data cleaning and descriptive statistics such as averages,
ranges, and distributions to summarize the data. Relationships between variables are
then explored to understand which factors have more influence and by roughly how much.

The results are supported using simple visualizations to compare patterns and trends.

Tools used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Excel
